# Traffic Detection üö¶üõ£Ô∏è
This project is a **YOLO-based real-time object detection system** focused on identifying traffic elements such as vehicles, pedestrians, and signals.

## üõ†Ô∏è What This Project Does
- Detects objects in images/video streams related to traffic scenes.
- Uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture for real-time object detection.
- Demonstrates model loading, image preprocessing, bounding box drawing, and inference using pretrained weights.

## üìö Acknowledgment
This entire project was completed with the assistance of **OpenAI's ChatGPT**, which helped generate code, explain concepts, and guide me through each step.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: All implementation and logic were derived through iterative assistance from OpenAI.

## ü§ñ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLOv5 / YOLOv8 (depending on your repo setup)
- PyTorch (if used)
- Jupyter Notebook / Flask (if applicable)
